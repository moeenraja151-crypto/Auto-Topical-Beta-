hey everyone,

this is the BETA version of the Topical Program i have built.

If you don't know what the program itself does, it compiles topicals from past papers of a specific paper, eg 0580 Maths P2, based upon the keywords that you provide (which are the topics you struggle on). this solves the major issue where many people don't have free access to these resources, as these are ussually paid and come at a premium cost.

It functions the same, although has a very basic ui and is nowhere near intuitive as the current Topcial Program. 

If you go my website and download the current program from there, alongside the program you get IGCSE, As and A2 yearly past papers which you can use to generate the topicals. In addition, you can join my discord server through the program and ask more yearlies for any other subject not already there, and for any other board besides CIE.


If you want to check out the current program, here's the website link: https://autotopical.netlify.app/
